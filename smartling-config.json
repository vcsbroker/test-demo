     //    authorizeContent - defines whether uploaded content will automatically be authorized for translation.
     //                       Possible values: "true" or "false". Default value is "true".
     //    pathRegex        - regular expression that filters resources to send to Smartling. It is required attribute.
     //                       Expression has groovy (Java 7) format. See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html

     //    smartlingDirectives       - string array with additional Smartling directives. Allowed directives depend on resource type.
